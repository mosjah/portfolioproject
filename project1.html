          <h2>Brief</h2>
          <p>This is Wolverine Wellness, an app designed to provide Mental Health Solutions at Your Fingertips for the University of Michigan (UM) community. As a class project, I took on the challenge of addressing the mental health struggles that I and my peers face, such as academic pressure, social isolation, and stigma surrounding mental health. Inspired by survey data, personal experiences, and conversations with friends, I wanted to create a solution that fosters peer connections and offers practical tools for improving mental health. The result: Wolverine Wellness—a resource center that combines accessibility, personalized support, and peer-to-peer community building.

          <h2>Suggestions: Solidifying the Direction</h2>
          <p>Based on feedback and analysis, I refined the direction with these key improvements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flow Improvements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Goals became the central navigation hub, making the user experience more intuitive.</li>
                <li>A calendar view was added to visualize mood trends and milestones.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Usability Enhancements:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Improved onboarding to better guide first-time users.</li>
                <li>Added labels and visual cues to simplify navigation and interactions.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature Expansion:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Enabled multiple peer connections to ensure users always had support.</li>
                <li>Integrated anonymous discussion spaces to reduce stigma and foster openness.</li>

          <p>The final design embodies these key elements:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Design Choices:</strong> The blue and maize color scheme was chosen for its association with UM.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Features:</strong> Peer-to-peer connections, mood tracking, and a safe, anonymous community feed.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Centric Approach:</strong> Every feature was tested and refined to address the specific frustrations and goals of UM students, ensuring accessibility, inclusivity, and reliability.</li>

          <h2>Reflections</h2>
          <p>Through the development of Wolverine Wellness, I learned the value of user-centered design and the importance of bridging gaps in traditional mental health resources with innovative, community-driven solutions. This project demonstrated how thoughtful design can empower students to take charge of their mental health while fostering a sense of connection and support.
